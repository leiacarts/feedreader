# FEED READS

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds with an incomplete test suite. The goal of the project was to complete the test suite.

## Overview

FEED READS is a Jasmine-based feed reader that assesses the success of a new batch of code. Through asynchronous testing, it signals either green (good to go) or red (check your code).

## Learning Objectives

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass. The objective for this project was to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Features

* An analysis of multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* An analysis of whether new code breaks an existing feature within the codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
